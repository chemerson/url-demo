This project demonstrates Applitools using the eyes-selenium-java3 SDK. The examples provided scan through a list of url's in the resources folder. The can be scanned with a local Chrome instance, a local Selenium grid with one Firefox and one Chrome instance that you must set up yourself (see https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium and try using docker-compose), or with the forthcoming Applitools Visual Grid.
